This comes as a way for people using Discord to socialize to listen to music, podcasts or anything else is on youtube togheter. After the takedowns made to popular Discord bots _(Remember Rythm, Groovy and those who served this pourpose)_, people were left with ghetto ways of playing audio content with others.

# Here this bot comes on

Using this bot on **small servers, and being hosted on your computer** should not upset Youtube so bad that takes the repo down. However we can't guarantee this.  

# Make hard copies of the repository, save locally, share among your friends
